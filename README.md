# sortable-drag-drop

This was a code along project that I did from Traversy Media (check the original here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wv7pvH1O5Ho&list=WL&index=118&t=156s)

To practice Javascript I decided this was a good video to code along with while learning how to use map(), sort(), swapping items using various drag events.  I definitely want to make some changes and turn this more into a game eventually.
